# Machine-Learning-Prediction
How to copy and use Machine Learning project:

Requirement to copy the app:
  -> Dataset of natural disaster
  -> Python installed
  -> Required libraries installed (e.g. numpy, sklearn, tensorflow, pandas, flask, request)

How to copy the project:
1) train.py file
  -> Used for training a machine learning model with neural network algorithm
  -> The script takes in data, processes it, and creates a trained model file (model_predict.h5)
2) main.py file
  ->Entry point for running a Flask web application
  ->It initializes the app and sets up routes, endpoints, and functionalities
3) test.py file
  ->Used for evaluating the trained model and testing the Flask app
  ->Send requests to the Flask app's endpoints and check responses and functionality
  ->Open the terminal on your desired folder, type "python test.py"
